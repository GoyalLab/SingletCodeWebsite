              intra-arterial delivery of mesenchymal stromal cells. Hence,
              quantification and efficient limitation of cell clumps in
              suspension before transplantation is important to reduce the
              risk. We used a flow cytometry-based pulse-width assay to assess
              the effects of different cell suspension concentrations (0.2-2.0
              $\times$ 10(6)/mL), storage solutions (complete growth medium,
              Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and normal saline), storage
              time in suspension (0-9 h), and freeze-thawing procedure on the
              clumping of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells
              (BMMSCs) and also evaluated cell viability at the same time.
              Surprisingly, increasing the cell concentration did not result in
              more cell clumps in vitro. Freshly harvested (fresh) cells in
              normal saline had significantly fewer cell clumps and also
              displayed high viability (>90\%). A time-dependent reduction in
              viability was observed for cells in all three storage solutions,
              without any significant change in the clumping tendency except
              for cells in medium. Fresh cells were more viable than their
              frozen-thawed counterparts, and fresh cells in normal saline had
              fewer cell clumps. In conclusion, cell clumping and viability
              could be affected by different cell preparation procedures, and
              quantification of cell clumping can be conducted using the flow
              cytometry-based pulse-width assay before intra-arterial cell
              delivery.",

              myeloid cells to promote tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth.
              Increasing interest has emerged on the identification of
              subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+) myeloid cells using
              flow cytometry techniques. In the literature, however,
              discrepancies exist on the phenotype of these cells (Coffelt et
              al., Am J Pathol 2010;176:1564-1576). Since flow cytometry
              analysis requires particular precautions for accurate sample
              preparation and trustable data acquisition, analysis, and
              interpretation, some discrepancies might be due to technical
              reasons rather than biological grounds. We used the syngenic
              orthotopic 4T1 mammary tumor model in immunocompetent BALB/c mice
              to analyze and compare the phenotype of CD11b(+) myeloid cells
              isolated from peripheral blood and from tumors, using six-color
              flow cytometry. We report here that the nonspecific antibody
              binding through Fc receptors, the presence of dead cells and cell
              doublets in tumor-derived samples concur to generate artifacts in
              the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+) subpopulations. We
              show that the heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+)
              subpopulations analyzed without particular precautions was
              greatly reduced upon Fc block treatment, dead cells, and cell
              doublets exclusion. Phenotyping of tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+)
              cells was particularly sensitive to these parameters compared to
              circulating CD11b(+) cells. Taken together, our results identify
              Fc block treatment, dead cells, and cell doublets exclusion as
              simple but crucial steps for the proper analysis of
              tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+) cell populations.",

              identifies doublets with greater accuracy than existing methods.
              Solo embeds cells unsupervised using a variational autoencoder
              and then appends a feed-forward neural network layer to the
              encoder to form a supervised classifier. We train this classifier
              to distinguish simulated doublets from the observed data. Solo
              can be applied in combination with experimental doublet detection
              methods to further purify scRNA-seq data to true single cells. It

              doublets, which appear to be-but are not-real cells, is a key
              confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have
              been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the
              scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these
              methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an
              appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a
              systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational
              doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets,
              which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112
              realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection
              methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental
              settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational
              efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited
              diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects.
              Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection

              responses, and either a t-test or a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW)
