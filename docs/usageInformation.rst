singletCode For Your Data
===================================

singletCode is a framework that can be extended to most RNAseq or even ATACseq data to accurately identify singlets.

For Barcoded Data
--------------------
If the data is barcoded, then it is straight-forward to use singletCode for the dataset. We provide both a python package called singletCode and a command lne interface. The only input needed is a csv file with cell ID, barcode and UMI counts for each barcode.
