barcoding technologies assessed
---------------------------------------

7 different barcoding technologies
We incorporated datasets using FateMap, ClonMapper, SPLINTR, LARRY, CellTag-multi, Watermelon, and TREX barcodes. Each have their own recovery and analysis specifications that we outline in Box 1 of our paper.

   *Schematic of the structure of different lineage-tracing barcodes, their length, diversity, and fluorescent color. Each barcode contains an expressed fluorescent protein, a unique sequence, known as the barcode, and a polyA tail for capture. The lengths of barcodes in each method are shown as scale bars, and library diversities are shown as circles, sized proportional to their diversity and colored according to fluorescent proteins used.*

   :alt: Stacked bar chart of cell types in all datasets. Each distinct color corresponds to one study, with the proportions of different cell types arranged from most to least prevalent (deepest to lightest) and separated by vertical lines. Adjacent to the bar chart, sketched tissues and cells provide a visualization of the cell types used in the particular study.
