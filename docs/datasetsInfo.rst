Datasets used in singletCode
===============================

7 different barcoding technologies
We incorporated datasets using FateMap, ClonMapper, SPLINTR, LARRY, CellTag-multi, Watermelon, and TREX barcodes. Each have their own recovery and analysis specifications that we outline in Box 1 of our paper.

   :alt: Stacked bar chart of cell types in all datasets. Each distinct color corresponds to one study, with the proportions of different cell types arranged from most to least prevalent (deepest to lightest) and separated by vertical lines. Adjacent to the bar chart, sketched tissues and cells provide a visualization of the cell types used in the particular study.
